## How to Create React APP + Vite (You can get more information from this [page](https://scrimba.com/articles/create-react-app-with-vite/))

```
npm create vite@latest
```
Vite makes life easy by prompting you with questions.

First, Vite asks for your project name.

Then, Vite will want to know if youâ€™re using React or another library

Here, I save vite-app at the my root directory and chose react. For doing that you only need to type ./ instead of the project name. Then

```
npm install

npm run dev

```
You can open the application on your browser [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
